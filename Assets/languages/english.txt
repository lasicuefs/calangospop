tutorial_1_text_1=Hi, Welcome to Calangos 3

tutorial_1_text_4=In this tutorial, we need to make sure that it grows over {0} individuals!
tutorial_1_text_5=But first, we need to learn more about the game
tutorial_1_text_6=As I said, this is your population
tutorial_1_text_7=This is your Biocoin counter, it shows you how much Biocoin you have
tutorial_1_text_8=Your Biocoin increases in time
tutorial_1_text_9=You can use the Biocoin to add new species of plants in the environment
tutorial_1_text_10=Here, you can choose which species to add
tutorial_1_text_11=Each species has unique carcteristics and a Biocoin cost
tutorial_1_text_12=You can only add a species if you have the required Biocoin
tutorial_1_text_13=Lets start! Add some vegetation to feed your lizards
tutorial_1_text_14=Good Game!

tutorial_2_text_1=Well done! Your population has grown.
tutorial_2_text_2=But be carefull so it won't grow too much!
tutorial_2_text_3=There is too much food and the population will grow unbalanced!
tutorial_2_text_4=Some species compete for food and can keep your population under control
tutorial_2_text_5=Insert some competitors to control the lizard population

tutorial_3_text_1=Atention! Your population keeps growing...
tutorial_3_text_2=We need more radical measures!
tutorial_3_text_3=You can add predators to reduce the population of lizards

tutorial_4_text_2=We need to provide shadows for the lizards
tutorial_4_text_3=Too much sun exposure can be letal
tutorial_4_text_4=Insert plants that project shadows to avoid their death

tutorial_sand_box_text_1=Congratulations! You now know everything about Calangos 3
tutorial_sand_box_text_2=Now, let's test what you just learned
tutorial_sand_box_text_3=Grow your population and keep it stable as long as you can!
